This repository contains the source code for the Double Pendulum Chaotic Dataset web page.

The Double Pendulum Chaotic Dataset consists of videos of the chaotic motion of a double pendulum filmed with a high speed camera, as well as the positions of the datums of the pendulum, generated by using pattern matching on the markers.
The dataset is released under the [CDLA Permissive Version 1.0](https://cdla.io/permissive-1-0/) license.
